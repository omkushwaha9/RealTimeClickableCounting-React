# RealTime Clickable Counting

The project features a minimalist user interface centered around a counter mechanism. This UI element consists of a bar displaying a counter that starts at zero and can increment indefinitely. Positioned to the right of this counter is a button. Each click on this button increases the count by one. For example, if the button is clicked three times, the counter will increment sequentially from 0 to 1, then 2, and finally to 3. This process continues with each additional button click, allowing the counter to increase without limit.
